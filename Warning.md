This organization is for REAL ethical hacking tools.

If you are here to joke, meme, role-play, or treat this like a game — leave now.

These repositories contain actual security tools used in real environments.
They are not demos.
They are not toys.
They are not content for laughs.

Expectations

Take the work seriously

Read documentation before touching anything

Understand what the code does

Use tools only with permission and legal scope

Not Allowed

Joke commits

Meme PRs

“lol hacking” behavior

Running tools without knowing what they do

Treating this org like a playground

If you can’t tell the difference between a real security tool and a joke,
you do not belong here.

Bottom line

Be professional.
Be responsible.
Or leave.

No warnings. No hand-holding.
